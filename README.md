RWTH-Poster
===========

Template for a LaTeX poster inspired by the RWTH style

1. replace the dummy files logo/logo*.pdf by the university/institute logo 
    (repo uses placeholders due to copyright contraints)
    
2. edit your personal settings in poster.tex

3. use e.g. Makefile to create poster in pdf format (default:a0,upright alignment)
